## Introduction

### Motivation

The focus of this study is on the DOHMH (Department of Health and Mental Hygiene) New York City Restaurant Inspection Results, which provides crucial information about food establishment inspections in the city. Given that the thriving food industry in New York City serves over 8 million people, ensuring food safety and quality is of utmost importance. The dataset contains valuable insights for multiple stakeholders, such as inspectors, restaurants, and customers. By analyzing the inspection results, we can uncover trends, patterns, and areas that need improvement. Furthermore, this study highlights the dataset's potential for promoting sustainability and creating a safer and healthier food industry environment for New York City residents.


### Dateset

The dataset used in this analysis is the DOHMH New York City Restaurant Inspection Results, which provides a comprehensive collection of inspection results for food establishments in New York City. This dataset comprises data from over 400,000 inspections conducted at more than 27,000 restaurants and food establishments across the city's five boroughs. Each inspection record includes essential information about the establishment, including the date, time, type of inspection, and the inspection outcome, which highlights the points deducted for any violations. This dataset offers a wealth of valuable information that can help identify areas that need improvement and promote a safer and healthier food industry environment in New York City.

### Objectives


Our research project has a set of specific objectives that we aim to achieve.Our objective can be divided into following three parts:

- **Firstly, we intend to gain a deeper understanding of the DOHMH New York City Restaurant Inspection Results dataset, including its content and structure.**
- **Secondly, we will analyze the inspection results across various dimensions, such as grade and score, boroughs, cuisine types, and violations, to identify trends and patterns that can provide insights for various stakeholders, including customers, inspectors, and restaurant owners.**
- **Finally, based on our analysis, we aim to make recommendations for improving food safety and quality, which can benefit all stakeholders in the New York City restaurant industry.**

Therefore, our objectives are not limited to answering questions, but rather to provide valuable insights and recommendations that can promote a safer and healthier food industry environment in New York City.



## Scores And Grades 

With the overall distribution of inspection scores in mind, let's take a closer look at how these scores translate into the grading system utilized by the regulatory authorities. This will allow us to better understand the performance of New York City restaurants in terms of hygiene and food safety compliance, as well as identify areas for improvement and targeted intervention. In the next chart, we will examine the distribution of scores in relation to the A, B, and C grade classifications, providing insights into the performance of restaurants across different grade categories.

**Distribution of scores by grade ⬇**

**Please note:** The chart above presents the distribution of health inspection scores with a cutoff at 50 for restaurants in New York City, categorized by A (blue), B (green), and C (yellow) grades. The grading system is straightforward: a score of 0-13 corresponds to an A grade, a score of 14-27 corresponds to a B grade, and a score of 28 and above corresponds to a C grade.

It is crucial to be cautious while choosing a restaurant to dine in Manhattan, especially in the southern area of the borough. This part has a high concentration of C-grade restaurants, which could pose a potential health risk. On the other hand, Staten Island has the lowest density of C-grade restaurants and the lowest scores, making it a safer choice for diners.Here you are, the following map gives you an overview of the C grade distribution in NewYork city.

B grade restaurants mainly have a density between 0.02 and 0.03, indicating that although these establishments meet the minimum hygiene requirements, there is room for improvement. Further analysis of the specific violations in these restaurants can help identify the areas that need attention, enabling the development of targeted intervention strategies.

C grade restaurants, represented by yellow bars, have a density lower than 0.02, decreasing as the score increases. The low density of C grade establishments suggests that only a small proportion of restaurants have severe hygiene issues. However, the presence of these restaurants indicates the need for continuous monitoring and strict enforcement of food safety regulations to protect public health.

The chart above presents a box plot comparing the distribution of violation scores across different boroughs in New York City: Manhattan, Queens, Bronx, Brooklyn, and Staten Island. The differences in violation scores within and between boroughs suggest varying levels of food safety compliance in these areas.

Staten Island has the lowest median violation score and a relatively smaller range between the lower and upper quartiles, indicating better overall compliance with food safety regulations and more consistent hygiene standards compared to other boroughs. This might be due to a smaller number of restaurants, closer-knit communities, or more effective enforcement.

Manhattan, despite having a slightly lower median violation score than Brooklyn, Queens, and Bronx, has a wide range of scores, with some establishments performing exceptionally well and others struggling to meet food safety standards.

**Blox plot of Grade distribution ⬇**

<iframe src="{{ '/assets/grade_percentage.html' | relative_url }}" width="120%" height="500"></iframe>

The chart displays the distribution of restaurant grades as a percentage of the total number of establishments. The X-axis represents the different grades (A, B, C, N, P, and Z), while the Y-axis shows the corresponding percentage of restaurants with each grade.

The majority of restaurants (69.7%) have received an A grade, reinforcing the findings from the score analysis that a significant proportion of establishments in New York City maintain high hygiene and food safety standards. B and C grades, representing 13.4% and 7.8% of restaurants respectively, highlight the need for targeted intervention and support to help these establishments improve their food safety compliance. N (6.3%) and Z (2.6%) grades are less common and are assigned to restaurants that are either new or have pending inspection results. The dataset does not include any restaurants with a P grade.

Building on the insights from the score analysis and the grade distribution, the chart above presents the distribution of violation scores for A, B, and C-grade restaurants. This information offers valuable context for stakeholders to better understand the varying levels of food safety compliance across the industry.

In light of the grade analysis, the following targeted suggestions can be proposed for different stakeholders to foster a culture of continuous improvement and maintain high-quality dining experiences for customers:

- **Regulatory authorities: Provide tailored support and resources to B and C-grade restaurants to help them elevate their food safety compliance and work towards achieving an A grade.**
- **Customers: Make informed dining choices based on the grades of restaurants, promoting a demand for higher food safety standards.**
- **Restaurant owners: Proactively review their restaurant's grade and violation scores, identifying areas for improvement and implementing necessary changes.**

By integrating the insights from both the score and grade analyses, stakeholders can work together to ensure high hygiene and food safety standards across the industry. This comprehensive approach to food safety compliance will contribute to an enhanced dining experience for customers, while also supporting the continuous improvement of establishments in New York City's vibrant food service sector.


## Cuisine Types

**Pie chart  of the percentage cuisine types ⬇**
<figure>
  <img src="{{ '/assets/reastau_pie_chart.png' | relative_url }}" width="500" height="300" alt="year pattern">
</figure>

For restaurant analysis, we first looked at the pie chart showing the distribution of restaurant types in New York City and also for getting the top 10 restaurant types. 

American restaurants are the most common type, accounting for 17.7% of all restaurants, followed by Chinese restaurants at 9.1%. The remaining restaurant types with labels, include Coffee/Tea, Pizza, Italian, Mexican, Bakery, Latin American, Japanese, and Caribbean with the percentage ranging from less than 3% to 7.8%.

Note that restaurant types with a percentage of less than 3% do not appear with a label in the chart.

**Grade distribution among top 10 restaurants ⬇**

<figure>
  <img src="{{ '/assets/10_pie_chart.png' | relative_url }}" width="500" height="300" alt="year pattern">
</figure>

Then we looked at the inspection scores of these ten restaurants. The grade types include A, B, and C, with A representing no critical violations found during the inspection, and C representing multiple critical violations found during the inspection. The chart shows that Coffee/Tea establishments have the highest percentage of A grades, while Caribbean restaurants have the lowest percentage of A grades. On the other hand, Latin American restaurants have the highest percentage of C grades, while Coffee/Tea establishments have the lowest percentage of C grades.

**Critical flag distribution among top 10 restaurants ⬇**

<figure>
  <img src="{{ '/assets/10_pie_critical_chart.png' | relative_url }}" width="500" height="300" alt="year pattern">
</figure>

After analyzing the inspection scores, we moved to the VIOLATION DESCRIPTION types for the top 10 types of restaurants. It is evident that different types of establishments exhibit varying degrees of compliance with food safety regulations.  "Critical" violations are those that are more likely to contribute to food contamination, illness, or other health hazards. "Not Critical" violations are those that are less likely to contribute to food contamination or illness but still require correction.  "Not Applicable" means that the violation does not apply to that specific establishment or is not applicable to the inspection type. The data varies little by restaurant type. 

Basically, these three violations of all types of restaurants didn't differ much. From the chart, we can see that Japanese Restaurants are with the highest Critical crime, 60.5%. Following that, that of Italian and Caribbean is 57.7% and 56.6%. And the rest of the restaurant types are also not low, all above 50%. 'Not applicable' of all types of restaurants are all below 2%. And the 'Not critical' accounts for about 40%.

**Chinese restaurants distribution among boroughs ⬇**

This map displays the distribution of Chinese restaurants across the five boroughs of New York City. Chinese cuisine is the second most popular type of cuisine in the city, and this map provides a visual representation of where these restaurants are located. The size of the markers on the map indicates the number of Chinese restaurants in each borough, with redder color indicating more restaurants. We found that the places with a higher density of Chinese restaurants are concentrated in Manhattan, Queens, and Brooklyn.

</figure>

For checking the restaurant information in different boroughs. We first look at the pie chart of the percentage of restaurants across each borough. It reveals that Manhattan has the highest percentage of restaurants at 37.6%, followed by Brooklyn at 27%, Queens at 22.6%, The Bronx at 9%, and Staten Island at 3.8%. We combined the Restaurants Distribution Map to get some insights below.

**Restaurants Distribution Map ⬇**

<iframe src="{{ '/assets/restaus_maps.html.html' | relative_url }}" width="100%" height="500"></iframe>

The plot shows the distribution of restaurants across the five boroughs of New York City: Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, The Bronx, and Staten Island. By hovering over each borough, you can see the number of restaurants in each area. We found that the number of restaurants is directly proportional to the density of New York's population. For instance, Manhattan, which has a population density of 28,872 people per km2 (according to Wikipedia's 2021 Census), has the highest number of restaurants at 37.6%, followed by Brooklyn at 27%, Queens at 22.6%, The Bronx at 9%, and Staten Island at 3.8%. 

**Boken Plot of Number Of Restaurants in Grades By Boros ⬇**

<iframe src="{{ '/assets/my_plot.html' | relative_url }}" width="130%" height="600"></iframe>

Then, we created the interactive bar chart shows the distribution of violation grades across the five boroughs of New York City: Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, The Bronx, and Staten Island. The x-axis represents the different violation grades, including A, B, C, N, P, and Z, while the y-axis represents the number of restaurants that received each grade. By clicking on each borough label, you can see the violation grade distribution for that specific area and compare the data between the boroughs.

We found that Grade A violations are the most common among all boroughs, while Grades B and C are less frequent but not rare, indicating that there is more room for improvement in food safety practices in certain areas.

## Violations

We further analyzed the violation data to better understand the common food safety issues in New York City restaurants and provide targeted recommendations for improvement. Here, we present the findings from our violation analysis.

**Bar Plot of Violation Codes as a Percentage of Total Violations ⬇**

<figure>
  <img src="{{ '/assets/vio_code_per.png' | relative_url }}" width="800" height="400" alt="year pattern">
</figure>

The chart above displays the percentage of violation codes found in New York City restaurants. The top five violation codes are 10F, 08A, 04L, 06D, and 02G, which account for more than 40% of all violations. The most common violations are related to improper construction or maintenance of non-food contact surfaces, conditions conducive to rodents, evidence of mice, improper sanitation of food contact surfaces, and improper holding temperatures of cold TCS food items. These violations can pose serious health risks to consumers and can result in the closure of restaurants.

## Recommendations

### Customer Recommendations

<figure>
  <img src="{{ '/assets/reastau_pie_chart.png' | relative_url }}" width="500" height="300" alt="year pattern">
</figure>

The plot clearly shows the percentage of restaurants in each of the 5 boroughs of New York City, highlighting the easiest places to find food. With almost 38% of the city's restaurants, Manhattan takes the lead, followed by Brooklyn with 27% and Queens with a slightly lower number. The Bronx accounts for less than 10%, while Staten Island has less than half that. Despite being the smallest area with only 22 square miles, Manhattan boasts the highest number of restaurants among all five boroughs, making it an ideal destination for food lovers. Manhattan offers the most diverse array of restaurant types among the five boroughs. So, if you're unsure of what kind of food you want to eat, just take a stroll around Manhattan and you're sure to find a restaurant that suits your taste buds.

### Inspector Recommendations
To promote a cleaner dining environment in New York, we suggest prioritizing inspections of restaurants with lower scores and more violations. This approach can help such restaurants improve their grades to an A faster. By focusing on historically problematic restaurants, we can have a greater impact on overall food safety. Our analysis revealed that the scores of restaurants in each borough were relatively similar.

**Blox plot of Score distribution by BORO⬇**

<iframe src="{{ '/assets/score_distribution.html' | relative_url }}" width="120%" height="500"></iframe>

Based on the box plot above, it is evident that the score distribution is nearly identical for all boroughs except for Staten Island. This suggests that New York City is consistently enforcing inspection standards across all areas, and restaurants are not lowering their standards based on their location. Additionally, Staten Island stands out with a lower score distribution, which is indicative of a cleaner dining environment.

**Score distribution of each cuisine type⬇**
<figure>
  <img src="{{ '/assets/scores_box.png' | relative_url }}" width="500" height="300" alt="year pattern">
</figure>


Each cuisine type is represented by a box plot above, and we can see that `Creole` cuisine has the highest average violation score, followed by `Creole/Cajun` , `Filipino`,`African`,`Southeast Asian`,`Chinese/Japanese`. These findings suggest that restaurants serving these cuisines may require additional guidance and support to improve their food safety practices. We recommend that regulatory authorities prioritize their efforts towards these restaurants, offering targeted training and resources to those struggling with food safety compliance. Increased attention to these higher-violation cuisine types could help lower the average score and narrow the range of scoring. And more frequently inspections could help lower the average score and shrink the range in scoring. 

**Percentage distribution of critical flag by grade⬇**

<iframe src="{{ '/assets/Critical_Flags.html' | relative_url }}" width="120%" height="500"></iframe>

It's important to note that even restaurants with an "A" grade are not immune to critical violations. In fact, almost 49% of these restaurants have been found to have such violations. These violations are often associated with food contamination, illness, or other health hazards. Therefore, it is crucial for inspectors to exercise caution when inspecting restaurants with an "A" grade, as there is still a possibility of serious violations.


### Restaurant Owner Recommendations

**Interactive plot of violation codes percentage by season ⬇**
<iframe src="{{ '/assets/violation_seasons.html' | relative_url }}" width="120%" height="500"></iframe>

Chart above presents the top five violation codes in each season, highlighting potential seasonal variations in food safety violations. Violations related to non-food contact surfaces, pests, and temperature control (such as codes 10F, 06D, 08A, and 02G) appear in the top five for all four seasons, indicating the need for year-round attention and prevention measures. Violation code 04N, which relates to filth flies, appears in the top five for fall. Code 04L, which relates to evidence of mice or live mice, appears in the top five for winter. These results suggest that restaurant owners should prioritize preventative measures that address year-round risks, such as effective pest control and regular cleaning and maintenance of non-food contact surfaces and equipment. Additionally, seasonal inspections could target specific issues that may arise during certain times of the year, such as pest control during the fall season.

This chart shows that food safety violations in New York City restaurants vary by season, but violations related to non-food contact surfaces, pests, and temperature control appear to be year-round risks. Restaurant owners should prioritize preventative measures and education efforts to reduce the number of food safety violations in New York City restaurants. By implementing effective pest control plans, regular cleaning and maintenance of non-food contact surfaces and equipment, and seasonal protocols that address specific risks, restaurant owners can help ensure that their establishments are safe and compliant with food safety regulations.
